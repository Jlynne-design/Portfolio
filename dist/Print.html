        <p>Creating HTML code for each webpage is the step I make. The first web page that I work on is the index webpage. This where the content is structured. Content is basically, text, images, and media. I added headers, navigation menu, and a button for my index webpage.
First, I placed an image to the background of the website. I went to pexels.com for my image. This website is free to use and the images are royalty free. Then I:<br/>
•	Put this image in the image folder
•	Copy file path for image<br/>
•	Link file path of background image in header section of the CSS file<br/>
Create a header and sub header for you web page. The header like a title for a page. I used JavaScript to a typewriting effect on my header. Then, create a button that will navigate to the next webpage. The index webpage also has a navigation section which allows you navigate to other webpages in the website. This section of the webpage is placed to the top. The button was then placed on the webpage.
Create the button in your html code and style it in your CSS code.
Once you have completed HTML code for all sections of your webpage, start styling your HTML by using CSS. Use CSS to style all content in your HTML code such as, text. You can change the font color, size, and set the font to display text in bold, and in cursive.
Link the CSS code to your HTML code. The CSS code will then be able to find HTML that needs to be styled.
You may also have to link a font style to the HTML code if a default font was not used. I used Google fonts for the fonts on my website. Create the graphics, multimedia, and print web page. I created an HTML code for each webpage. Each webpage has a header with a navigation menu, and a header. Linked the CSS file to each webpage. The image in the header for each webpage is linked in the CSS code. This image is linked to each webpage in the CSS code. 
After all the coding is complete, the website is published. I use GitHub to store my files for the website. You will have to store your website files in repository. I then used Netlify to publish my website. Netlify takes your repository from GitHub and deploys the deploys your website. A generate website address is generate for the website.
