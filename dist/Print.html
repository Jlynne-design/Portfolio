        <h3>Plan and Structure Website</h3>
        <p class="lead2">
          Before I create a website, I write down what languages and software I am going to use. Then I write down the steps to develop the website. The languages I used to create the website are, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The applications that were used for this website are Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Netlify, and Google Fonts. Then I write down steps to organize my website. Here are my steps.
•	Create a main folder for the website
•	Create a CSS folder
•	Create a folder for the JavaScript file
•	Create an image folder
•	Create webpages and place them in the main folder for the website
        </p>
        <h3>Creating HTML code for each webpage</h3>
        <p class="lead2">
            The first web page that I work on is the index webpage. This where the content is structured. Content is text, images, and media. I added headers, a navigation menu, and a button for my index webpage.
First, I placed an image in the background of the website. I went to pexels.com for my image. This website is free to use and the images are royalty-free. Then I:
•	Put this image in the image folder
•	Copied the file path for the image
•	Linked file path of background image in the header section of the CSS file
        </p>
        <h3>Crate a header and subheader for your webpage</h3>
        <p class="lead2">
          The header is like a title for a page. I used JavaScript to a typewriting effect on my header. Then, I created a button that will navigate to the next webpage. The index webpage also has a navigation section that allows you to navigate to other web pages on the website. This section of the webpage is placed at the top. The button was then placed on the webpage. Create the button in your HTML code and style it in your CSS code. 
Once you have completed HTML code for all sections of your webpage, start styling your HTML by using CSS. Use CSS to style all content in your HTML code such as text and images. You can change the font color, size, and set the font to display text in bold, and in cursive.
Link the CSS code to your HTML code. The CSS code will then be able to find HTML that needs to be styled.</p>
<p class="lead2">You may also have to link a font style to the HTML code if a default font was not used. I used Google fonts for the fonts on my website. Create the graphics, multimedia, and print web page. 
  I created an HTML code for each webpage. Each webpage has a header with a navigation menu and a header. Linked the CSS file to each webpage. The image in the header for each webpage is linked in the CSS code. This image is linked to each webpage in the CSS code.</p>
        <h3>Publish Website</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          After all the coding is complete, the website is published. I used GitHub to store my files for the website. You will have to store your website files in a repository. I then used Netlify to publish my website. 
          Netlify takes your repository from GitHub and deploys the deploys your website. A generic website address is generated for the website.
